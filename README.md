For this assignment I had to implement a shooting mechanic for the player to shoot at the enemies.
Then I had to write a function to detect collision with the enemies and the bullet
If there is a collision, it damages the enemy and gives you points.
When the enemy health hits 0 they are destroyed and points are rewarded.
